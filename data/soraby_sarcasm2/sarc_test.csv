1,"This argument is self-defeating. A theory is not a fact, no matter how much evidence may support the theory. Bad wording.

2,"So, once again, the lack of criminal prosecution isn't due to the red herring that you claim, but rather the incompetence of the Justice Department. Franken's bill doesn't have a provision for making the Justice Department do its job, does it?",1
3,"The simple fact is that people don't want the immense responsibility that logically pertains to their voluntary actions actions, so they fabricate denials of reality as a convenient escape, out of pure selfishness-- like every other atrocity in history.   The study of law includes an analysis of how people excuse their wrongdoings, fabricating pausible rationalizations for their acting to benefit at another's expense; denial is typically the first of these, claiming that the act ""does not hurt anyone,"" however obvious the contrary. Other rationales follow, such as self-preservation, natural right to act, and eventually growing defensive by blaming the victim.   While the fabricator typically believes his story original, it is anything but-- it's simply the inevitable course of selfishness.",0

8,"Again, I don't know what happenstance origins are, but ruling something out because it's unlikely doesn't work. I have made the poker analogy very often. If you are dealt in order, the 3 of spades, then the 5 of hearts, then the 9 of clubs, then the 4 of diamonds, then the 6 of hearts, would you decide immediately that it was not true? The odds are (1/52)*(1/51)*(1/50)*(1/49)*(1/48) = 1/311,875,200.This could be done for multiple games. The odds get slimmer and slimmer, but the difference is that something had to happen. No matter what cards you got, the odds of you getting the same card in that order would be this slim.",0

11,"This whole riff where people talk about preventing employers from firing gays JUST cause they are gay as a ""special right"" is something that seems to fool those who are prejudiced against gays...... but for most people, they recognize it as a propagandic phrasing with little merit.I think our laws should include something that prevents people from firing employees based on the employee's sexual orientation.But to utilize your phrasing Archie, do you think that religion is something that deserves ""special rights""?",0

26,"Your reason for believing this lies entirely within the Bible. I hardly consider a 1500 year old book ""making clear what he wants"". Particularly given that even among those who believe the book, they still can't agree on what God wants. And of course, that doesn't even beging to address the issue of all the other holy books which contradict the Christian Bible. You may personally believe that you know what God wants, but if so it's not because God has been clear about it.",0

29,"Actually, they are genetic. Our cells have receptors which are triggered by exposure to pathogens; that's how we ""learn"" to fight off a disease. And not everyone has the same receptors, which ones you posses is a genetic trait. It's one of the reasons that Native Americans were so vulnerable to European diseases, they hadn't evolved the receptors that would have enabled them to build up defences against the diseases the Europeans had lived with for generations. If your hypothesis was correct we wouldn't see different populations having different reactions to the same disease.",0
30,"But even worse, even if there were some unknown mechanism to cause such movement, it would generate heat.

Am I forcing these voters to attend my wedding or dare I say be in a marriage themselves?And I cannot agree with you more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole.. We are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around...What I find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are, and how we pay taxes just like every other joe schmo they'll think nothing more of special rights lol...But actually like I stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples I would be content.",0

53,You draw very interesting conclusions my friend.   If this is your standpoint then what is the purpose of a government?,1
54,"Exactly. Trying to prove that God, if he exists, didn't make us as good as an all powerful being should have made us doesn't prove anything in the God debate. I could always debate that since God is all powerful and all knowing he could have always thought of something better to do. If he made those changes, then of course there would still be something better he could have thought of. This would be an endless loop of creating something better and better until finally he would have to stop and say that is good enough. But even then this debate that he didn't make us as good as he could have would be valid in my view.",0

But basically other people have said it. They're protected by the Constitution, they generally result in lower crime rates, and they can be used for defense as well as hunting. Oh, but the burden of proof isn't on the people supporting guns, but those who wish to ban guns. Most arguments for banning guns are easily refutable.",1
58,"Well, one can't be truly logical and not be an atheist (or at least agnostic.) As any religion simply flys in the face of logic. Faith and logic are poles apart.

61,"If you still believe this way, then you must believe then it is OK to kill a child that has been born if it might not be loved, or might suffer, etc. That is the logical conclusion to your argument. If an unborn child and a born child are the same to you, then you cannot make a distinction as to which one should be killed and which one shouldn't. That is the spiralling hole into which abortion leads. There is a basic loss of respect for human life. Your defense actually scares me more than someone who deceives themself into believing the unborn child is not alive.",0

Darwin proposed that natural selection is responsible for the diversification of species. This pre-Darwin concept denies this.

Until recently, when they realized that evolutionary theory could help out in their how-many-animals-could-fit-on-the-ark dilemma; now they suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science and propose that suddenly all the present species could ""micro-evolve"" from a few ancestral ""kinds"" on the ark.",0

THere are many historically valid poems. Plus, when read figuratively, Genesis poses no conflict at all with science.   Evolution is not the only science that demonstrates Genesis can not be read literally. What about the speed of light from the stars, geology, genetics, comparative embryology, etc. The only stumbling block between science and faith is a strictly literal interpretation.
